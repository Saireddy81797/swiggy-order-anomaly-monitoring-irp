<p>

This project simulates a **Swiggy-like real-time monitoring system** designed for production environments where data pipelines, model outputs, and platform performance need constant supervision.

It reflects the responsibilities of an:

✅ Associate Data Scientist  
✅ ML Monitoring Engineer  
✅ Data Operations / On-call Data Support  

with focus on:

- Automated Alert Monitoring  
- Incident Response Execution  
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA)  
- Production Stability  
- Dashboard-based Debugging  
- KPI Anomaly Detection  

---

## 🔥 Key Features

- Real-Time KPI Monitoring  
  - Order Volume / min  
  - Average Delivery Time  
  - Payment Failure Rate  
  - API Error Rate  

- Automated Anomaly Detection  
- Incident Logging with Severity  
- Human-Readable RCA Summary  
- Incident Response Plan (IRP) included  
- Streamlit-based Monitoring UI  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- CSV-based Incident Logging  
- (Spark/SQL Ready Architecture)  

---
## Role Alignment (Why This Project Matters)

- This project demonstrates skills required in real-world Data Science production support roles, including:
- Monitoring automated alerts across domains
- Debugging issues using logs & dashboards
- Determining operational vs model-related issues
- Structured incident reporting
- KPI deviation interpretation
- Documentation discipline (IRP + logs)

## Incident Response Plan (IRP) Includes:
- Alerts & Trigger Conditions
- First-Line Debugging Checklist
- Observability Tools
